# rshell

## Coding Requirements
This program acts as a command shell and performs the following:

1. Prints a command prompt.
2. Reads in a command on one line. These commands take the form:

```
cmd = executable [argumentList] [connector cmd]
connector = || or && or ;
```

Note this program can take more than one command on a line and can be separated by connectors. There are no limits to the nuber of commands which can be chained together, and any combination of operators can be handled. 

## Known Bugs
We have not created test files yet; therefore, we do not have any bugs to document yet.
